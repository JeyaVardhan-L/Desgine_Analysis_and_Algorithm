# Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms. It works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing adjacent elements, and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. 



The algorithm gets its name because smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list, while larger elements sink to the bottom.

### Complexity Analysis
* **Time Complexity:** * **Best Case:** $O(n)$ - Occurs when the array is already sorted (thanks to the optimization flag we added).
  * **Worst Case:** $O(n^2)$ - Occurs when the array is reverse sorted.
  * **Average Case:** $O(n^2)$
* **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ - It sorts in-place, meaning it only requires a single extra memory space for the `temp` variable during a swap.

### When to use it?
In professional environments, Bubble Sort is rarely used for large datasets because $O(n^2)$ time complexity is terribly inefficient compared to Quick Sort or Merge Sort. However, it is useful in computer graphics for detecting a very small error in almost-sorted arrays and fixing it with linear complexity.
